# Symon

## Vision
Symon is a tool for discovering the subtile differences between words in your
language or a language you are learning.

Imagine this:

While reading your favorite German newspaper you come across the word
"ertragen". Having never seen the word, you run over to your favorite
dictionary and look up the word only to find a less than satisfying definition:
"to endure". Wait a minute! Doesn't "aushalten" mean "to endure"?!

In a panic you start searching for the difference between the two words only to
find that "erdulden", "andauern", "ausstehen" and many more words are
translated as "to endure" in your dictionary.

Do they all mean the same thing? When can should I use one versuses the others? AHHH!!!!

No worries! The community at Symon has your back!

With Symon you will be able to:

* See example usage
* Read an explanation of which words to use in which context
* See which words are more formal than others
* Ask questions to native speakers about usage
* See recent newspaper articles featuring the word
* See recent tweets featuring the word
* See usage statistics from Google
* And much more!
